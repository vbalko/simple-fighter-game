# 2D Fighting Game

## Notes from the Idea Maker

This game is a concept that explores the potential of AI, specifically ChatGPT, in game development. The idea was to see if an AI model could understand the requirements and create a whole game from scratch. The experiment was quite successful, and it showed that AI can indeed play a significant role in game development.

## Concept

The game is set in a 2D environment where two fighters compete against each other. Each fighter is controlled by a set of commands that allow them to move around the battlefield and engage in combat. One fighter is controlled by the player using keyboard inputs, while the other fighter is controlled by an AI.

The fighters can move left, right, and jump to dodge attacks. They can also punch to attack their opponent. Each successful punch decreases the opponent's health. The game continues until one fighter's health reaches zero, at which point the game ends and the remaining fighter is declared the winner.

## Gameplay

As a player, you control your fighter's movements and actions using the following keys:

- W: Jump
- A: Move left
- D: Move right
- S: Punch

The AI-controlled fighter responds to your actions and makes its own decisions based on the game's AI logic. This makes each game unique and challenging as the AI fighter adapts to your play style.

## Visuals

The game features simple yet engaging visuals. Each fighter is represented by a colored rectangle, and their health is displayed as a bar at the top of the screen. The game also includes a background to enhance the visual experience.
